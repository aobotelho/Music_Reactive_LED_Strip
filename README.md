# MusicReactiveLEDStrip
This is the repo for my music reactive LED Strip project
The first version is was made using a really cheap usb speaker board.
The second has an amplification stage using a 741 Op. Amp. for the audio amplification before the LED driving stage.

The three LED colors are driven after the amplified audio passes through a filter, so each of the LEDs is driven by different frequencies.
